    <p>You declare him as the killer and the police are called. Smugly, you walk away from a job well done although the necklace is never found and all the evidence is circumstantial. </p>
    <p>Years later, after your man dies in prison, the necklace is discovered amongst the items bequeathed in Emily's estate. A chill runs down your spine as you realize that an innocent man was sent to jail and died there because you of you and your hasty accusation. The guilt eats at you in your remaining years until you can no longer look at yourself in the mirror. You find you can only pray that whatever gods there may be, they are merciful and can forgive your grievous error.</p>
