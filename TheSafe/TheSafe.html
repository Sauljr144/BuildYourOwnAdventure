      You decide to take a closer look at the safe. As you approach, you notice
      that it has been opened, the door left ajar. Upon looking inside, you
      discover it is empty. Inquiring with the family, it seems like the main
      item kept in there was Mr. Watson's late wife's heirloom necklace. Someone
      has stolen it!

      The fighting between the siblings escalates into near pandemonium. In the
      enraged shrieking match, Emily lets it slip that she had become aware that
      her father was cutting her out of his will and planned to leave his entire
      fortune to her two brothers.
