      You decide to talk to Jack and discover that he is being sued by his ex
      for back-child suport by his ex-girlfriend. Bitterly he recounts his
      suspicions that the child is not even his and their tempestuous split. His
      is desperate for money at this point and you realize he has laid all his
      hopes at solvency on the family inheritance to get him through.
