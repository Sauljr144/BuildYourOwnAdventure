    <p>
      In terror at the unexpected turn of events, you flee into the inky, sodden
      darkness. You'll make a statement with the police when you make it to the
      next town, you reason with yourself. As you turn the last corner to exit
      the property, you feel a sudden sharp pain in your chest. Stunned, you
      look down to see a knife protruding, leaking crimson blood down your
      shirt. In shock, you look back up into the eyes of your killer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No witnesses," they growl gutterally to you before fading back into the
      ebony void of night. Looks like you won't be tell the police anything,
      after all.
