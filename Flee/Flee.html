      In terror at the unexpected turn of events, you flee into the inky, sodden
      darkness. You'll make a statement with the police when you make it to the
      next town, you reason with yourself. As you turn the last corner to exit
      the property, you feel a sudden sharp pain in your chest. Stunned, you
      look down to see a knife protruding, leaking crimson blood down your
      shirt. In shock, you look back up into the eyes of your killer.

      "No witnesses," they growl gutterally to you before fading back into the
      ebony void of night. Looks like you won't be tell the police anything,
      after all.
