            You are traveling down a lonely road on a stormy night. You car breaks down. You wander a short distance to find a mansion and knock on the door. 
         </p>
        <p>

            Mr. Watson enthusiastically welcomes in to shelter from the storm but others are more reluctant. You sit down to a meal with everyone and begin to eat. Suddenly, a  lightning strike knocks out all of the power. 
        </p>
        <p>The generaters kick in, but in the darkness, Mr. Watson was murdered!
        </p>
