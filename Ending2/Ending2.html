    <h1>Guilty Emily:</h1>
    <p>
      Emily admits to killing her father. She found out she wasn't getting
      anything from the family inheritance; she would not even be getting their
      mother's jewelry! She decided to stop him before he could rewrite it, only
      to find out the amendment had already done and was then stored in the
      safe. She took the will out and destroyed it, taking the necklace along
      with it in order to make it look like a run of the mill theft. The police
      are called and Emily is escorted to jail.
