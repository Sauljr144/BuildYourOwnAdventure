    <h1>David:</h1>
    <p>
      You decide to talk to David and discover that he likes to gamble and live
      large. It was in these pursuits that he racked up quite a large debt,
      first to frivolous spending, then in doing business with a local loan
      shark who is now aggressively seeking remuneration.It quickly becomes
      evident that David's only hope of survival - both financially and
      literally - are dependent upon inheriting a sizeable sum from the family
      inheritance.

    <p>
      However, as you continue to talk to him, you notice the safe on the other
      side of the room. Something about it seems... not quite right.
    </p>
    <p>What Will You Do?</p>
