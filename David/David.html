      You decide to talk to David and discover that he likes to gamble and live
      large. It was in these pursuits that he racked up quite a large debt,
      first to frivolous spending, then in doing business with a local loan
      shark who is now aggressively seeking remuneration.It quickly becomes
      evident that David's only hope of survival - both financially and
      literally - are dependent upon inheriting a sizeable sum from the family
      inheritance.

      However, as you continue to talk to him, you notice the safe on the other
      side of the room. Something about it seems... not quite right.
